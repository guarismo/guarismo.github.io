## Tips from the North Pole Elves

Hello again,

Long time no see.

I was working on the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge and at last I've submitted my write up today, although I couldn't find 2 NetWars coins.

I'll share my solutions once the challenge is over after January 4th.

For now, I want to share the tips that the Elves from the North Pole gave us to help with the challenges.

The Elves in the North Pole give a lot of information and tips about possible vulnerabilities that can be exploited and tools to use.
