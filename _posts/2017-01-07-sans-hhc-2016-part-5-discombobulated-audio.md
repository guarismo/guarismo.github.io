I used Audicity on my Windows 10 laptop to apply filters and effects to the MP3 files.

At first I thought each file contained a word to form a sentence, but making changes on each file didn’t help, it wasn’t possible to understand them all like that.

My friend, who works with audio and video editing, suggested putting them together one after the other, and I decided since I have 7 files, each 7 seconds long to change the tempo to 1 second each for a total of 7 seconds.

7 files changed to 1 sec Tempo per file in order

When I played the result it said

***[“Father Christmas, Santa Claus. Or, as I've always known him, Jeff.”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_juDo4YVSAWVnpINTU1dXpRNFU/view?usp=sharing)***

Which is a quote from **Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol (2010)**

That whole sentence was the passphrase for the last door without a terminal where I found The Doctor who confessed kidnapping Santa to use he’s powers for a greater good, removing the existence of the Star Wars Holiday Special from 1978.

9) Who is the villain behind the nefarious plot.

The Doctor. (wrongly called Dr. Who, unless there’s a legal copyright/trademark issue)

To be more precise, the fourth incarnation of The Doctor from the BBC TV Show Doctor Who (the scarf gave it away J)

10) Why had the villain abducted Santa?

The Doctor did it because he’s a mad man with a box and was trying to use Santa’s powerful North Pole Wonderland Magick to prevent the Star Wars Holiday Special from being EVER released because he visited a universe where 1978 didn’t have the SWHS and everyone was happy! J
